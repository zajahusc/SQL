# SQL

Welcome to my SQL Code Repository! This collection showcases SQL scripts and queries Iâ€™ve written, covering everything from foundational concepts to advanced techniques. These scripts reflect my personal learning, projects, and professional experience (all of which I am legally permitted to share). I hope this repository can serve as a resource for others learning SQL or looking for practical examples to build on.
